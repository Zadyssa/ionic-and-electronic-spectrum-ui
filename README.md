# ionic-and-electronic-spectrum-ui
It is a code written during my internship at LULI (Laboratoire pour l'Utilisations des Lasers Intenses). It was my very first time coding a GUI and my first time using tkinter too so the program may contains some bugs I did not identify during the process. As far as I know, it is functionable. It is based on the code created by Raymond Diab

You can analyze ionic and electronic images to draw ionic and electronic spectrums. This way, you can compare your experimental results to theoretical ones.
